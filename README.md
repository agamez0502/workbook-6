## 💡 Core Concepts

- 🤝 **Interfaces** — Defines a contract that classes can implement, enabling multiple types to be treated uniformly.  
- 🧬 **Interface-Based Programming** — Encourages loose coupling by coding to interfaces rather than specific implementations.  
- ♻️ **Default Methods in Interfaces** — Provides method implementations in interfaces to reduce boilerplate in implementing classes.  
- 📚 **Generics** — Allows classes and methods to operate on typed parameters, improving code flexibility and type safety.  
- 🔒 **Bounded Type Parameters** — Restricts generics to certain types, adding control while preserving generic flexibility.  
- 🚀 **Java Streams** — Processes collections in a functional style for cleaner and more efficient data handling.  
- ➕ **Lambda Expressions** — Enables concise definition of anonymous functions, often used with collections and streams.  
- 🧪 **Stream Operations** — Includes methods like `filter()`, `map()`, `reduce()`, `sorted()`, and `forEach()` for powerful data pipelines.  
- 📦 **Java Packages** — Organizes classes into namespaces to manage large codebases and support modular development.  
- 🌿 **Git Branching & Merging** — Supports version control with isolated development environments and merge conflict resolution.
